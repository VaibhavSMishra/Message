      Hi Garima,<br>
      Hope you'll respect my feelings and praise my efforts as my words are not enough to explain my emotions.<br>
      You are one of the best person i evermate, so just want to share some feelings to you.<br>
      This is message from my heart, and it is not for proposal purpose
      as i think proposal makes the simple friendship toxic and it all depends on you.<br>
      If any word makes you uncomfortable i extremly sorry for that.<br>
      As you already know some life incidents had changed my life completly and i don't want to repeat otherwise you will say everytime i am stuck and 
      crying for the same 😅 as the person who is very close to my heart where i express my all feelings is no more thats why i am stuck over there
      and i don't know why form the very first day when you talk with me my heart felt too calm as the way talk with me and 
      i started missing you whenever you are free we will talk as it makes me calm, i don't want to disturb you so that i never make a call form my side so I wanna say that
      whenever you have free time please call me.🥺<br>
      I know many boys approches girls for friendship and you can't trust each and everyone
      and May be i'm not your type but trust me i will be the best person you ever met in your life.<br>
      I am introvert and orthodox type so i am unable to say those magical 3 magical words so easily to everyone
      until an unless we have mutual confidence between us and i am not as others boys genz type who just met and say i take time to build trust
      and i follow traditional values either good or bad stay forever in any conditions.<br>
      I am not like others who show off there parents wealth as i think what you have done is yours and be self made man.
      if you take my opinion trust on those person who respect and care for you i am not talking for my self any person in your Life whome you trust but trust wisely.
      I think you are not like  others girls who just play with feelings, <br> 
      You also think that "Do Shabd pyar se kya karlo piche hi pad jate hain" 😅 (but mai piche padunga jab tak tum bhaga na do) jokesapart
      its true i like your behaviour and the way you talk , accent and your laugh and i know with respect to time you lose interest in me but mai nahi i have same 
      feeling and respect for life time.<br>
      You wanna know that whether i am sure or not i am sure by my side and hopes from your end too<br>
      I don't force you to go with me i just want to express that if you are with me,<br>
      I know i am not as others are but if you trust on me i'll provide you each and everything as possible by me.<br>
      I just want someone whome i share my feelings and respect i'm not like others those having cunning motives may be my words can't explain my feelings good.
      I thinks you understand me little that how i am i just say you can trust and atleast give one chance.<br>
      If you give me chance i'll achieve each and everything you expect from me.
      I am not forcing you to meet me i just want to introduce myself in better way so that you
      better understand me, if you are not intrested we just talking like that if you want.hope you will give me chance too as early as possible. 🥺<br>
       may be i am not as per you but if you give me chance i'll be.<br>
      these all words are just my feelings don't take it otherwise i don't know how to express my feeling yeah i am intrested in you
      but trust me i am not like others who cheat and make use of others,i am very simple  person have you ever met may be this thing you won't like there are too many things to express leave it fir kabhi.
