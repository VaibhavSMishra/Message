      Hi Garima,
      Hope you'll respect my feelings and praise my efforts, as my words are not enough to explain my emotions.<br>
      Hope my previous messages are not the best for conveying my feelings, so I tried once more to explain in a better way 
      , and I'll keep trying until you don't get my message, what I wanna say to you.<br>
      In the Last message, you said that "Am I time pass for you?" Do you think so? Am I time passing with you? No, not all.
      I don't know but may be god knows well, I keep trying to texting and talking with you and want to stay connected with
      you, i also use to check what text you send me at every faction of time 😅 as i get good vibes from you don't take it otherwise 
      there is no such other intention as i wanna explain you as i can explain by my words.<br>
      Maybe you do not feel as connected as I 😅 cause you are one of the best person I've ever met in my life, and I am not that's why you do not feel for me 😂.<br> 

      The very first day when we talked together and the way you talked made me feel good,
      I like the vibe and way you talked with me, and it's like dopamine for me, and from that day, I like to talk with you.
      I think you are kind, helpful, and innocent in nature, as all these things I get from our conversation with you.
      I have never seen you, but I am sharing these things on behalf of the behaviour, talks, and chats as a response I got from you.
      We all have too many people around us to share our feelings, but you can't share them with everyone. You will share with only those people with where you feel 
      emotionally safe and connected, so I think you get why I share some of my things with you.<br>

      I have seen some of your pictures, you look too cute in that 😊😊, but one of your pictures in your highlight seems to me like I have seen you somewhere I don't know.<br>
      Yes, I like your behaviour, your nature, and the way you talk makes me very comfortable, and I know maybe there is a chance that I am not as per you, but I wanna be
      as like as you.<br>

      I know that you just wanna know my intentions and feelings for you, as you already know that my intentions and feelings do not matter until and unless there is a mutual response.
 I have hesitation in thinking that way, as it may ruin our friendship, and then it will reflect 
      on our friendship, and you will stop responding to me, that's why I never tried cause i not wanna lose you, at least friendship remains for a lifetime.
      Second, I am an Orthodox-type person having some traditional values, as I am a one-woman type. If she is interested, I will spend the rest of my life with her may be you can't
      believe as many do not, but I am.
      I also wanna say if you are interested, you can try me, at least give me a chance  so that I can show  how I am, whether what I am saying in my words is real or just
      fake words.<br>
      Yeah, i Know in girls life too many boys approaches them and show of there lifestyle, richness and many more thing even they try to buy emotions
      by showing there prosperity but trust me take my opinion never trust on those guys be with those who is thinks emotionally, caring, responsible respectful and
      thinks about you once you show confidence on such type of guys he will do anything for you. you know, once you get emotional satisfaction, then other satisfaction 
      is just a piece of paper. It is already well known that whatever is in our destiny no one can change, like the example of Seeta, her Father weds her daughter to the crown prince of
      Ayodhya, but still she spent her whole life in the jungle, still she was satisfied as she was emotionally satisfied by Bhagwan Ram.<br>
      All the Above Para, I am not talking about myself I just wanna say that please go with those people where you feel emotionally well, rather than someone who
      is flexing their prosperity as time passes. People change their faces who are just time passes, and it all depends on both genders, whether male or female, 
      Hope you understand my words.<br>
      As we have never seen each other, and you don't know my behavior and etiquette, but all these things I am sharing on behalf of your behavior.
      Hope my example will help you to think that emotions and feelings are the major things in this world rest of the rest are useless. You can buy anything in your life 
      , but a good friend, a loyal partner, never so try to find peace in life.<br>

      I know Girls are more fond of the materialistic world, and this is not bad too, but trust that person, he will provide you each everything in your life as he is
      too desperate to provide things too loving loves.<br>
      I wanna meet with you just to explain me, myself, my behaviour, my lifestyle and all i know it may be not like by you cause i am as simple as any person you
      ever met, i'm not too much handsome and all may be our first meeting will be last 😅 but emotions to emotions hai and after all it all depends on you<br>
      But I wanna say that if you trust me I'll be the best person you ever met in your life, that's all from my side hope you not get bored.<br>
      At last i wanna say first meet me understand and then think cause emotional connections hurts lot and if you are ready then i'm with you as i know mai tumhare 
      layak nahi 😢.<br><br>

      Hi Garima,<br>
      Hope you'll respect my feelings and praise my efforts as my words are not enough to explain my emotions.<br>
      You are one of the best person i evermate, so just want to share some feelings to you.<br>
      This is message from my heart, and it is not for proposal purpose
      as i think proposal makes the simple friendship toxic and it all depends on you.<br>
      If any word makes you uncomfortable i extremly sorry for that.<br>
      As you already know some life incidents had changed my life completly and i don't want to repeat otherwise you will say everytime i am stuck and 
      crying for the same 😅 as the person who is very close to my heart where i express my all feelings is no more thats why i am stuck over there
      and i don't know why form the very first day when you talk with me my heart felt too calm as the way talk with me and 
      i started missing you whenever you are free we will talk as it makes me calm, i don't want to disturb you so that i never make a call form my side so I wanna say that
      whenever you have free time please call me.🥺<br>
      I know many boys approches girls for friendship and you can't trust each and everyone
      and May be i'm not your type but trust me i will be the best person you ever met in your life.<br>
      I am introvert and orthodox type so i am unable to say those magical 3 magical words so easily to everyone
      until an unless we have mutual confidence between us and i am not as others boys genz type who just met and say i take time to build trust
      and i follow traditional values either good or bad stay forever in any conditions.<br>
      I am not like others who show off there parents wealth as i think what you have done is yours and be self made man.
      if you take my opinion trust on those person who respect and care for you i am not talking for my self any person in your Life whome you trust but trust wisely.
      I think you are not like  others girls who just play with feelings, <br> 
      You also think that "Do Shabd pyar se kya karlo piche hi pad jate hain" 😅 (but mai piche padunga jab tak tum bhaga na do) jokesapart
      its true i like your behaviour and the way you talk , accent and your laugh and i know with respect to time you lose interest in me but mai nahi i have same 
      feeling and respect for life time.<br>
      You wanna know that whether i am sure or not i am sure by my side and hopes from your end too<br>
      I don't force you to accept me i just want to express that if you are with me then what should i do,<br>
      I know i am not as others are but if you trust on me i'll provide you each and everything as possible by me.<br>
      I just want someone whome i share my feelings and respect i'm not like others those having cunning motives may be my words can't explain my feelings good.
      I thinks you understand me little that how i am i just say you can trust and atleast give one chance.<br>
      If you give me chance i'll achieve each and everything you expect from me.
      I am not forcing you to meet me i just want to introduce myself in better way so that you
      better understand me, if you are not intrested we just talking like that if you want.hope you will give me chance too as early as possible. 🥺<br>
       May be i am not as per you and old school type guy who is not too much impressive by looks but if you understand me you will never regret in your entire life and if you give me chance i'll try to be as per you😊.<br>
      these all words are just my feelings don't take it otherwise i don't know how to express my feeling yeah i am intrested in you
      but trust me i am not like others who cheat and make use of others,i am very simple  person have you ever met may be this thing you won't like.<br>
      My intentions are just to share my feelings to person who understand me and respect my values nothing else.<br>
      There are too many things to express leave it fir kabhi but i also wanna no what you think about me.
